~2 hours

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered? 
Looks like everything is working :)

What two additional features did you build? Why?
1) A way for customer return the products they bought (customer purchases)
2) A better way to return transactions (Transaction.find_by_customer)
Extra bonus: Unit tests for all the code

Where do you still have room to grow?
Code style probably, I am not sure if my code looks like a "good ruby code"
